# About Me

Hi there, My name is Jacob Huber, but you might know me as cobmin. That's my username, a name that combines "cob," which my friends call me, and "admin."

## Professional Journey

I currently work for a healthcare company as a software engineer who provides custom solutions for customer business needs. I also help our clients work with our APIs. I have been doing this for a few years now and find it to be a nice place to work in comparison to what I was doing prior, Restaurant Management. I do miss the free Chipotle though. Transitioning from restaurant management to software engineering, I've found that skills in team management and customer service have been invaluable in understanding and addressing client needs in the tech world.

## Personal Interests

When I'm not working, I love spending time with my wife and various activities. My wife and I enjoy traveling, exploring botanical gardens, and indulging in a good glass of wine. Personally, I'm quite passionate about blockchain technology, investing, and real estate. I also like watching ice hockey and am gradually getting back into exercising.

## Passion for Technology

Since I was young, I have always had an interest in technology. At first, it was mostly focused on gaming, but as I grew older, I became interested in building my own things and learning about blockchain technology. I am constantly seeking new ways to improve my skills and knowledge in this field, with the ultimate goal of using my knowledge to help others and make a positive impact in the world.

I made Maize, an NFT toolkit that helps users create and manage NFTs on Loopring. I also have started making Cob's Farm, a pixel art game in LooperLands.

## Thank You

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better. I hope you enjoy reading my blog and learning from my experiences.

If you're interested in Blockchain, NFTs, or just want to follow along with my adventures, feel free to connect with me on Twitter or Discord. I'm always excited to share insights and learn from others in the community.
